Lab 5 Evaluation Document

Description:
Intent: We decided that for the theme of light and dark that we wanted to do a Day and Night type of game. The user has been placed in the middle of the woods. 

Narrative Structure: You are on the run from the zombie apocalypse in the middle of a terrible winter. You don’t know where anyone is, but for now you have a small fire to stay warm with some walls that look like the groundwork for  a building that was never finished. How many days can you avoid the zombies?  

Mechanics: To move the character, use WASD, and to change the rotation of the camera, use the mouse. As you leave the fires into the cold, you start to freeze to death. You must get back to a fire to reset your cold meter back to zero. Stay away from the zombies because they can hurt you. 

Aesthetics: We have a day/night cycle that transforms a bright, crisp, snowy day into a dark, dreadful, snowy night.  

Joys: Finally getting the world lighting to work properly and it has a spooky vibe at night time. Finally getting the whole game to work.

Struggles: Importing the mixamo animation proved to be difficult. The textures and the animation didn’t want to be imported all together. To get the entire 3D model, you had to download the texture of the character and then the animation and place them in the same folder before importing it to Unity. Figuring out the lighting and what little setting was messing up the whole thing was quite frustrating. Getting the cold bar to work was the most frustrating thing. 

Contributions:
Olivia: created the world with trees and invisible walls so the user doesn’t fall into an infinite gorge. Also imported the 3D models of the zombie and campfire. And created the main menu and end scene. 

Jake: Created health bar and cold bar UI with gradient so script changes the color of bar accordingly, while Mitchell and Jonathon helped implement it to work with the world environment. Designed world lighting, including the day/night cycle so its spooky at night.Created the fire shader for the campfires. Attempted snow shader, but ran out of time. Created a timer to see how long a player can survive. 

Mars: Created the snowy ground, set up player movement. 

Jonathon: I implemented the NavMesh Zombie AI and created the scene transitions to begin with. Then I modified the main menu to have a background, expanded the map, and increased the number of zombies significantly. Since everything started to become a mess, I organized things. Towards the end I changed everything around to get the health bar to work after moving it to the main GUI and tweaked various other little things throughout the project.   

Mitchell: I implemented the camera movement as well as the player movement. I also worked on getting the cold bar to move up and down depending on if you are by a fire. This part took me the longest time, and I scrapped everything and I fixed it in a much simpler way that I had started. So I essentially wasted a lot of my time. I think the thing that made the cold bar hard for me was not knowing how everything in our project was connected. I didn't know how to link everything up, and because of that it made it a mess to try to code. After things got organized, I was able to clearly see how I could get it to work. For the player movement, I set it up along with the camera so that you walk in the direction you’re facing. There was the ability to jump but we took that out.
